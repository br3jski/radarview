# About RawFlight 

RawFlight is a revived from 2020 project of community flight tracking system. 
For now, RawFlight is in closed beta stage and access to RawFlight is granted to feeders only with limit of 2 concurrent sessions. Once we exit closed beta (we plan to release public beta by the end of 2024), RawFlight will become public for everyone again.
Open-Source solutions used in RawFlight: Combine1090 with custom configuration
We have written all necessary data collection scripts on our own, so you can simply download our script and start being a RawFlight Feeder!

## Installation

Simply download installation script and let it do all work for you, 

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br3jski/rawflight_eu/main/install_rawflight.sh | bash
```
Or, if you prefer to use wget, execute: 
```bash
wget -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br3jski/rawflight_eu/main/install_rawflight.sh install_rawflight.sh | bash install_rawflight.sh
```

## Roadmap?
We will present it soon ;)
